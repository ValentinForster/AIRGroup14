## Objective

In this project, we aim to compare the performance of a DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) model that is pretrained with a model fine-tuned specifically for the German language. We will be using German datasets for the fine-tuning process.

## Datasets

For our fine-tuning experiments, we will utilize the German datasets provided by Deepset.ai, specifically the GermanQuad dataset. You can find the datasets [here](https://www.deepset.ai/germanquad).

## Notes

- We will explore whether it is more effective to use a pretrained DPR model on German datasets or fine-tune a model from scratch.
- We acknowledge that the dataset lacks Score and Title Score, which are usually present in DPR datasets. This missing data may impact our results, and we will address this limitation in our analysis.

Should we use article titles or chapter titles as the main title for our project? Further discussions and decisions will be made during the course of the project.
